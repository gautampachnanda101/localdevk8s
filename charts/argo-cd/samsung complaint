Hello Gautam,

Upgrade successful. Your new Galaxy is on its way.

Reference number: 1380629

What happens next?

Soon you will receive a Samsung Upgrade return pack to send us your old device. Please transfer all your data to your new Galaxy smartphone and then factory reset your old Galaxy S23 Ultra - S918B before sending it to us.

IMPORTANT

Please do not use the return slip that comes with your new Galaxy device. You must use the return pack we send you separately. Following an incorrect returns process will result in a delay processing your order.
‎10:12 AM
Thank you for clarification.
I suggest to reach out to our recycle team for the request for the return pack of return label for your old device.
‎10:13 AM
Here is our recycle team email at samsung@tradeinresponse.co.uk. You can also request for an extension on sending your old device because you will wait for the return pack or return label to be sent to you.
‎10:14 AM
I haven't heard from you for over two minutes now. Could you please let me know if we are still connected?
‎10:17 AM
I am just going to email them. By the way this experience is very bad. I dont see why I have to chase samsung inspite of being a long term customer. Can you please register a complaint on my behalf no  and I dont want another email address please
‎10:20 AM
We sincerely apologise if you did not receive a return pack for your old device.
If you want we can raise the request for the return pack for you for our recycle team.
